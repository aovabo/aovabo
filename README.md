**Short Description**  
Hello, my name is Alexander. I love finding security vulnerabilities and developing exploits, as well as fixing functional bugs. I am very fascinated by IT, security, privacy, and compliance engineering.

**I am actively seeking new opportunities where I can apply my skills and continue learning.**

**Recent Learning & Skills Acquired**

Recently completed a course on **AI Agents**, gaining proficiency in:

*   **Agent Fundamentals:** Understanding core concepts like Tools, Thoughts, Actions, Observations, LLMs, messages, and chat templates.
*   **Agent Libraries:** Learning to use established frameworks such as `smolagents`, `LlamaIndex`, and `LangGraph`.
*   **Hands-on Development:** Applying concepts to train agents in unique environments, including Hugging Face Spaces.
*   **Fine-tuning:** Gaining experience with fine-tuning LLMs for function calling.
*   **Observability & Evaluation:** Learning techniques for tracing and evaluating agents for production readiness.
*   **Use Cases:** Building agents to solve real-world problems in IT, Security, Privacy, and Compliance Engineering.

**AI Skills & Expertise**

*   Proven expertise in implementing Generative AI techniques, including prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and embeddings for any usecase.
*   Experience with commercially available APIs (Google, Azure, OpenAI) for text/image generation, embeddings, function calling, LLM fine-tuning, and proficiency in fine-tuning prompts for high-quality outcomes.
*   Proficiency in deploying and optimizing open-source Generative AI models (LLaMA, Gemma, Qwen), along with familiarity with related toolchains (Ollama, LM Studio, Docker Model Runner).
*   Familiarity with eval frameworks, agent tooling, RAG pipelines, and prompt engineering, and llm/agent security.
*   Deep understanding of concepts and algorithms underlying machine learning and LLMs.
*   Proven experience in LLM product implementation with APIs, back-end and front-end interfaces.
